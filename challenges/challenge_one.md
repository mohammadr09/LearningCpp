# Challenge 1: Student Grade Calculator
*ChatGPT Generated*

Write a C++ program that calculates the average grade of students in a class. The program should prompt the user to enter the `number of students` and the `number of subjects`. Then, it should ask the user to `enter the grades of each student for each subject`. Finally, it should calculate and display the average grade for each student and the overall class average.

Here's an outline of how you can structure the program:
1. Prompt the user to enter the number of students and the number of subjects.
2. Use nested loops to input the grades of each student for each subject.
3. Calculate the average grade for each student and store it.
4. Calculate the overall class average.
5. Display the average grade for each student and the overall class average.
